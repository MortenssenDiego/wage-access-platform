# Welcome to the Wage Access Platform challenge!

I used Remix to make a fullstack app in the short time window given to complete this challenge. Works with Remix Vite React for the backend with the frontend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Objective

Build a simplified version of a wage access platform that enables employees to request early access to earned wages. This challenge covers creating a backend service to process these requests, a frontend interface for user interactions, and basic deployment using Docker.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now you will be able to access it through `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.

## Automated Local Deploy

First, install docker and docker-compose if not already installed, then run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Now you will be able to access it through `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
